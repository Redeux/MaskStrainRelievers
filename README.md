# MaskStrainRelievers
Here is theantidoteftc's design for a Mask Strain Reliever to be worn in the back of the head while utilizing surgical masks, N95s or any other face covering that typically catches behind the ear.  The strain reliever redirects the strain on the back of the ear to behind the head, allowing for increase comfort while healthcare workers work for prolonged periods of time.  We are planning on submitting for NIH review.  Let me know if you have any suggestions or comments!
